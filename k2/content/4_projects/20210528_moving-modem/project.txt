Text: Above all, modem’s practice is informed by places and ecologies. Until 2018, our home of more than a decade was Oakland, California — a place at the edge of social, economic and environmental sustainability.  In 2019, we stepped away from production to study the manifestation of global technological transformations and ecological crises, traveling through China to Kazakhstan, India and Vietnam.  The advent of the Covid pandemic in 2020 shifted our itinerary towards our new home in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
