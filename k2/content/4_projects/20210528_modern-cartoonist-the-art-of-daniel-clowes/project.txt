This exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago was first developed as an installation for the Oakland Museum of California in 2012. A series of uncannily-scaled furnishings engaged the body of the viewer at a range of intimate scales.  To create the gallery furniture, relief drawings were prepared in collaboration with Clowes, then translated into CNC-milled panels, custom upholstery patterns and fabricated steel furniture. An expanded version of the exhibition incorporated large-scale reliefs—digitally fabricated in collaboration with the artist—onto the gallery walls.
