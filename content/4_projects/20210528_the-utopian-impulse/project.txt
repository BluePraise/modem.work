402 models of the Local Code San Francisco case study were fabricated for an installation at the inaugural <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.biennialoftheamericas.org/">Biennial of the Americas</a> in Denver, CO. The installation joined work by three other architects, and 28 artists from North and South America in the historic McNichols building in Downtown Denver. Taken together, the models formed a landscape arranged by topography and geography in San Francisco, and forming a 1:1 model of a single potential intervention.   This work was also featured as part of the exhibit The Utopian Impulse : Buckminster Fuller and the Bay Area, curated by Jennifer Dunlop Fletcher at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sfmoma.org/">SFMOMA</a>, and smaller exhibitions at Yale University and the Australian Embassy to the United States in Washington, DC.
