Modem collaborated on the design and fabrication of the exhibit Archæology in Reverse with the noted Bay Area photographer and artist Catherine Wagner. More than a simple display of photographs, the exhibition is an excavation of, and installation into, the fabric of the century-old Mills College Art Museum building. Incorporating optical devices from periscopes to colored filters between inside and outside, the design of the exhibit pays tribute to the diligent observation of the temporary architectures of construction, demolition and transport documented in Wagner’s 50-year career.
