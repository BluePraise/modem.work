Excerptedtext: For the 2018 exhibition marking the end of Catherine Wagner’s tenure as the Dean of the Arts at Mills College in Oakland, modem collaborated with the artist to create a series of architectural instruments and interventions within the fabric of the Mills College Art Museum. Enabling what Wagner terms ‘Archaeology in Reverse,’ these building-scaled periscopes, filters, furniture and landscapes frame photographs, sculptures, performances, and, above all, the 100-year old architecture of the museum itself.
