Excerptedtext: Modem designed the installation for Doug Hall's 2-channel video piece, shown at the Rena Bransten Gallery in 2018. A tensile structure allowed a 10-foot cantilevered screen to extend into the gallery, and was paired with an anamorphic projection of the video's second channel onto the gallery walls.
